    title: Cloud Solutions
    content: Enterprise software development has undergone major changes with the advent of the cloud, and tech leaders need to keep up with these changes to stay relevant with the market. I've handled generic lift and shifts as well as full scale application redesigns, with a special focus on budget friendly solutions and a security first model. I have extensive experience developing Azure solutions, and I am currently digging into Google's Cloud Platform (which is what the site is currently being hosted from!). I also have implemented a variety of solutions in AWS, primarily using their EC2, S3, and Lambda offerings.

    title: Full Stack Development
    content: I've been writing code for over 15 years, starting with simple scripts programmed into my TI-83. I've implemented software in more languages and frameworks than I can possibly list here, and plan to continue staying up to date with whatever the future holds. Recently, I've been focused on building microservice oriented solutions end solutions in .NET, with a large variety of backing data store solutions such as SQL Server and CosmosDB. Finally, I have spent the last few years writing front end solutions using Angular 2+.

    title: Architecture
    content: Building maintainable, scalable solutions is a talent every good engineer needs to invest in. I've designed monolithic architectures using relevant software design patterns, and more recently have been designing applications with a service oriented architecture, with each service following design patterns that offer scalability and flexibility. Additionaly, I have experience implementing cloud native event driven architectures using messaging technologies such as Azure Service Bus or RabbitMQ, and handling events with cloud services such as Azure Functions or AWS Lambdas.
