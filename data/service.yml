    title: Cloud Solutions
    content: Enterprise software development has undergone major changes with the advent of the cloud, and tech leaders need to keep up with these changes to stay relevant. I've handled generic lift and shifts as well as full-scale application redesigns, with a special focus on budget-friendly solutions and a security first model. I have extensive experience developing Azure solutions, and I am currently exploring Google's Cloud Platform. I have also implemented a variety of AWS solutions, primarily using their EC2, S3, and Lambda offerings.

    title: Architecture
    content: Building maintainable, scalable solutions is a talent every quality engineer needs to invest in. I've built simple monolithic applications that are hosted on premise as well as complex event-drive service-oriented applications in the cloud. Understanding when to use one architectural pattern over another is challenging, but I have a lot of experience learning how to make the best choice.

    title: Full Stack Development
    content: I've been writing code for over 15 years, starting with simple scripts programmed into my TI-83. I've implemented software in many different languages using many different frameworks, and I will continue to stay up to date with whatever technologies the future brings. Recently, I've been focused on building microservice-oriented solutions in .NET paired with a variety of backing data store solutions such as SQL Server and CosmosDB. I have also spent the past few years writing front end solutions using Angular 2+.

    title: DevOps
    content: Deploying changes to production efficiently and with confidence is difficult. It requires a well-planned set of instructions for infrastructure changes, high quality testing against code and features, and approval from internal and external stakeholders. A short feedback loop helps minimize risk when shipping code, and my experience using technologies such as Docker and Terraform, ideologies like Agile, and practices such as "Automate Everything" will help improve communication throughout the software development process.

    title: Team Leadership
    content: An organization is only as strong as its teams, so it's important for those teams to be helmed by a strong leader. Over the past several years, I've had the pleasure of leading and mentoring dozens of individuals, from recent bootcamp graduates to seasoned veterans. By understanding that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and catering to their strengths, I've successfully managed teams that consistently ship quality code on time and under budget.

    title: Enterprise Consulting
    content: I started my software career at a boutique consulting firm, where I learned many of the skills that I have today. While I may not currently be in a consulting role, I have retained the qualities that make a consultant valuable - being a self-starter who can find solutions to problems quickly, while using technologies that may not be familiar, and working under time and financial constraints.
