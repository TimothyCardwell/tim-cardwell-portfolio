    title: Cloud Solutions
    content: Enterprise software development has undergone major changes with the advent of the cloud, and tech leaders need to keep up with these changes to stay relevant. I've handled generic lift and shifts as well as full scale application redesigns, with a special focus on budget friendly solutions and a security first model. I have extensive experience developing Azure solutions, and I am currently digging into Google's Cloud Platform (which is what the site is currently being hosted from!). I also have implemented a variety of solutions in AWS, primarily using their EC2, S3, and Lambda offerings.

    title: Architecture
    content: Building maintainable, scalable solutions is a talent every good engineer needs to invest in. I've built simple monolithic applications that are hosted on premise, as well as more complex service oriented applications that use event driven design in the cloud. Understanding when to use one architecture over another is tough to do, and I have had plenty of experience learning how to make the right choice.

    title: Full Stack Development
    content: I've been writing code for over 15 years, starting with simple scripts programmed into my TI-83. I've implemented software in many different languages using many different frameworks, and plan to continue staying up to date with whatever the future holds. Recently, I've been focused on building micro-service oriented solutions in .NET, paired with a variety of backing data store solutions such as SQL Server and CosmosDB. Finally, I have spent the last few years writing front end solutions using Angular 2+.

    title: DevOps
    content: Confidently and efficiently deploying changes to production is tough; it requires a well planned set of instructions for infrastructure changes, high quality testing against code and features, and approval from internal and external stakeholders. A short feedback loop helps minimize risk when shipping code, and I have experience using technologies such as Docker and Terraform, idealogies like Agile, and practices such as 'Automate Everything' that all help achieve that quick feedback loop.

    title: Team Leadership
    content: An organization is only as strong as the groups that make up it, so it's important for those groups to be helmed by a strong leader. Over the last few years I've had the pleasure of leading and mentoring dozens of individuals, ranging from brand new bootcamp graduates to seasoned veterans who have been in the industry for over a decade. Understanding that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and catering to their strengths, is how I've managed to lead teams that consistently ship quality code on time and under budget.

    title: Enterprise Consulting
    content: I started my career at a boutique consulting firm where I learned many of the skills listed previously. While I may not currently be in a consulting role, I have retained the skillsets that make a consultant valuable. This includes being a self starter; someone who can find a solution to a problem quickly, using technologies they don't have experience in, under time and monetary constraints.
